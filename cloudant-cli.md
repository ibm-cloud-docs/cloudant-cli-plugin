<!-- File guidance:
This template is for creating command-line interface (CLI) reference that's generated by the OpenAPI SDKGen project. This template includes only the front matter for your CLI reference. You'll paste the command information that's generated from the CLI after this front matter content.

Name your file `offering-cli-name.md`, for example, `container-registry-cli.md` is the file name of the Container Registry CLI reference topic. Delete content examples that you are not using for your offering and these comments before pushing to production. -->

<!-- Title guidance:
In the title, list the name of your CLI, such as "Container Registry CLI (ibmcloud cr): https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=container-registry-cli-plugin-containerregcli
Also provide an appropriate ID above that aligns with your offering name, for example: #container-registry-cli. *All* IDs must be unique across *all* CLI references. -->

# {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} CLI
{: #cloudant-cli}

<!-- Short description: REQUIRED
The short description section should include one to two sentences describing why a developer would want to use this cli. This should be conversational style. For search engine optimization, include your offering's CLI name. Keep the {: shortdesc} after the first paragraph so that the framework renders it properly.
Example: -->

The {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Command Line Interface (CLI) provides extra capabilities for service offerings. You can use {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} CLI plug-in to manage throughput details and event types that are being sent from your {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} account to the {{site.data.keyword.at_full}} service.
{: shortdesc}

<!-- Prerequisites: REQUIRED
This section tells users what's required to install and use the CLI commands. If your plug-in requires detailed or lengthy configuration steps, link out to a separate task topic. -->

## Prerequisites
{: #cloudant-cli-prereq}

* Install the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI](/docs/cli?topic=cli-getting-started).
* Install the {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} CLI by running the following command:

```sh
ibmcloud plugin install cloudant
```
{: pre}

<!-- Optionally include any other post-installation configuration that might be required for your service. -->

* Use [`ibmcloud login` command](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cli-ibmcloud_cli#ibmcloud_login) for logging in to your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account.
* Set {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} service URL. For more information, see [Service configuration](#service-configuration).

You're notified on the command line when updates to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI and plug-ins are available. Be sure to keep your CLI up to date so that you can use the latest commands. You can view the current version of all installed plug-ins by running `ibmcloud plugin list`.
{: tip}

<!-- Other Prerequisites/Authorization/Environment: OPTIONAL
List any other prerequisites/authorization/environments that are required to use the CLI commands. Or give a brief introduction to the prerequisites/authorization/environments that the CLI commands might use. Use H3 headings (###) as needed to organize your content.
Example: -->

### Service configuration
When you make a server resource request, the Cloudant account URL from the service credentials (for example,`https://account.appdomain.cloud`) is not available automatically in the plug-in. You need to set the `CLOUDANT_URL` environment variable.
You can define this variable two ways:
1. Export them as environment variables, for example,`export CLOUDANT_URL=...`.
2. Store them in a [credentials file](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudant?code=go#authentication-with-external-configuration).

As an alternative to `ibmcloud login`, you can set the environment variable `CLOUDANT_APIKEY` to an IAM API key.
{: tip}

<!-- Paste your generated CLI reference after this point -->
