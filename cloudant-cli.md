<!-- File guidance:
This template is for creating command-line interface (CLI) reference that's generated by the OpenAPI SDKGen project. This template includes only the front matter for your CLI reference. You'll paste the command information that's generated from the CLI after this front matter content.
 
Name your file `offering-cli-name.md`, for example, `container-registry-cli.md` is the file name of the Container Registry CLI reference topic. Delete content examples that you are not using for your offering and these comments before pushing to production. -->

<!-- Title guidance:
In the title, list the name of your CLI, such as "Container Registry CLI (ibmcloud cr): https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=container-registry-cli-plugin-containerregcli
Also provide an appropriate ID above that aligns with your offering name, for example: #container-registry-cli. *All* IDs must be unique across *all* CLI references. -->

# {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} CLI
{: #cloudant-cli-plugin}

<!-- Short description: REQUIRED
The short description section should include one to two sentences describing why a developer would want to use this cli. This should be conversational style. For search engine optimization, include your offering's CLI name. Keep the {: shortdesc} after the first paragraph so that the framework renders it properly.
Example: -->

The {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} command-line interface (CLI) provides extra capabilities for service offerings. You can use {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI to manage V2 service brokers and templates.
{: shortdesc} 

<!-- Prerequisites: REQUIRED
This section tells users what's required to install and use the CLI commands. If your plug-in requires detailed or lengthy configuration steps, link out to a separate task topic. -->

<!-- Change the ID below to match your CLI. -->
